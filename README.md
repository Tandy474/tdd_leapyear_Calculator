Leap Year Calculator 
This project demonstrates a complete Test Driven Development (TDD) workflow in Python by implementing a simple Leap Year Calculator.
The goal is to show how to write tests first, implement only the minimum code required to make them pass, and then refactor safely under test coverage.
A GitHub Actions Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline automatically runs the tests on every push.
What Is a Leap Year?
A year is considered a leap year if it satisfies the following rules:
1.	If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
2.	Else if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year.
3.	Else if the year is divisible by 4, it is a leap year.
4.	Otherwise, it is not a leap year.
